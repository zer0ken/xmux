//! The control-mode (`-CC`) protocol surface a backend exposes to the host reader.
//!
//! A mux with a host-level control stream (tmux) hides ALL its `-CC` wire details
//! behind this trait: line framing/classification, the notification→event policy
//! table, and the control-mode command-line builders. `host.rs` drives the reader
//! state machine + FIFO correlation but names no tmux protocol specifics directly —
//! it reaches them only through `Backend::control_protocol`.
